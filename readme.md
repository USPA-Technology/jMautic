jMautic
=======

jMautic is a Java client for the [Mautic REST API](https://developer.mautic.org/#rest-api). With it,
you can write Java code to interact with several Mautic APIs, such as reading your contacts
programatically.



Example
-------

[src/test/java/com/leonardofischer/jmautic/examples/OAuth2Example.java](https://github.com/lgfischer/jMautic/blob/master/src/test/java/com/leonardofischer/jmautic/examples/OAuth2Example.java)

    package com.leonardofischer.jmautic.examples;

    import com.leonardofischer.jmautic.*;
    import com.leonardofischer.jmautic.model.*;

    import java.util.Iterator;
    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class OAuth2Example {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            try {
                // Initialize a service
                OAuth2Service service = new OAuth2Service()
                    .instanceUrl("YOUR MAUTIC INSTANCE URL")
                    .apiKey("API KEY")
                    .apiSecret("API SECRET")
                    .callbackUrl("AUTHORIZED CALLBACK URL")
                    .initService();

                // Get authorization to access the Mautic API
                String url = service.getAuthorizationUrl();
                System.out.println("Go to '"+url+"', authorize, and paste the code here");
                Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
                String code = in.nextLine();
                service.setAuthorizationCode(code);
                MauticApi mauticApi = service.build();

                // Execute API calls
                ListContactsResult result = mauticApi.listContacts();
                System.out.println("There are "+result.getTotal()+" contacts. These are "
                    +result.getContacts().size()+" of them:");
                Iterator<Contact> contactsIterator = result.getContacts().iterator();
                while( contactsIterator.hasNext() ) {
                    Contact contact = contactsIterator.next();
                    printContact(contact);
                }
            }
            catch(MauticException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        static void printContact(Contact contact) {
            System.out.print("- id="+contact.id+"; ");
            Iterator it = contact.allFields.entrySet().iterator();
            while( it.hasNext() ) {
                Map.Entry field = (Map.Entry)it.next();
                if( field.getValue()!=null ) {
                    System.out.print(field.getKey() + "="+field.getValue()+"; ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }



Features
--------

Right now, jMautic is able to:

- Access the Mautic REST API using Java (or any other JVM compatible language);
- Read contacts;

The implemented Mautic endpoints are accessible through the [MauticApi class](https://lgfischer.github.io/jMautic/latest/javadoc/com/leonardofischer/jmautic/MauticApi.html).

In the future, it should support:

- Access the Mautic REST API using OAuth1a;
- Updating contacts;
- Accessing other endpoints (such as Assets, Campaigns, Forms, Segments, Pages, etc).


How to Use
----------

### Dependencies

Right now, you need to [download](https://github.com/lgfischer/jMautic/archive/master.zip) or clone jMautic locally to [build it](#user-content-how-to-build). Then you need to include the build/libs/jMautic-0.0.1.jar file into your project. You also need to include the following .jars in your project:

- [SLF4J API Module - 1.7.21](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.21)
- [ScribeJava Core - 3.0.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.scribejava/scribejava-core/3.0.0)
- [Jackson Databind - 2.8.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.8.1)
- [Joda Time - 2.9.4](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/joda-time/joda-time/2.9.4)

If this project gets traction, I'll work on an easier way to integrate jMautic into your projects.

### Writing Code

Create a instance of <code>OAuth2Service</code> (right now jMautic supports OAuth2, but in the
future you may use other services here). Then configure the service with your Mautic instance access
tokens.

If its the first time connecting to the Mautic server, you need to authorize it. Use the
<code>service.getAuthorizationUrl()</code> method to get a URL and send your user to that URL. The
user will need to enter their credentials and confirm that your application is able to connect with
his credentials. If the user confirms, Mautic will redirect the user to a <code>callbackUrl</code>,
with a <code>code</code> parameter. You need to set this <code>code</code> in the
<code>service.setAuthorizationCode(code)</code> method.

If the authorization process completes successfully, you can use
<code>service.getAccessToken()</code> and <code>service.getRefreshToken()</code> to reuse later when
creating the <code>OAuth2Service</code>.

Finally, call <code>service.build()</code> to get a <code>MauticApi</code> instance. This object
has all the implemented methods from the Mautic API.

Read more about the authentication process in the [OAuth2Service class Javadoc](https://lgfischer.github.io/jMautic/latest/javadoc/com/leonardofischer/jmautic/OAuth2Service.html).



Documentation
-------------

Here is the [latest jMautic Javadoc](http://lgfischer.github.io/jMautic/latest/javadoc/).



How to Build
------------

Just run

    ./gradlew jar

The code should be built on the <code>build/libs/jMautic-[version].jar</code> file.


### How to Test

Some jMautic tests need to connect to a real Mautic API to pass. You will need to configure the
Mautic instance (as well as the API key and secret).

First, open <code>jMauticTest.properties</code> and add valid configurations for
<code>instanceUrl</code>, <code>callbackUrl</code>, <code>apiKey</code> and <code>apiSecret</code>.
Some of the tests try to connect to a real Mautic Rest API, and will use the one on available on
these options.

Then, run

    ./gradlew configure
    
and follow the instructions on the output. This need to be done only once after you checkout the code.

Finally, run

    ./gradlew test
